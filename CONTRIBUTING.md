# First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? 
- You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
   * Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   * Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
   * Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
